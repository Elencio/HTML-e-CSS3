                <p>
                    The front-end is built using a combination of technologies such as Hypertext
                    Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).Front-end
                    developers design and construct the user experience elements on the web page
                    or app including buttons, menus, pages, links, graphics and more. Hypertext(HTML)
                    Markup Language is the core of a website, providing the overall design and
                    functionality. (CSS)Cascading style sheets give developers a flexible, precise way to
                    create attractive, interactive website designs. (JavaScript) This event-based language
                    is useful for creating dynamic elements on static HTML web pages

                Front-end developers are still definitely still in demand. If you take a look at online
                recruitment sites such as Indeed, you will find no less than between 4,000 and 7,000 job
                postings for front-end developers per country. That is a staggering amount. Moreover, If
                you look at global Google trends since December 2011, you will find that the search term
                for front-end developers has risen almost 300% in the last ten years. With these two
                statistics, we can comfortably say that the job position for front-end developers is still
                in high demand worldwide. Although it may seem to many that front-end developers are not in
                high demand, the fact of reality is that good ones are. We can see this from tens of thousands
                of international job listings along with an increase in salary over the past 20 years by almost
                35%. Hence, there is no doubt that there is still plenty of room for this profession to grow.
                The only factor to consider is that this profession is ever-changing along with modern technology,
                so what entails being a front-end developer today may not be what it is tomorrow.

                    There are different types of web developers, all of whom participate
                     in the coding, analysis, and maintenance of the websites and 
                     applications that drive businesses and organizations, from 
                     nonprofits to major e-commerce projects. While a back end developer 
                     might build the infrastructure that enables a website to handle 
                     queries, data requests, and innovative search structures, a front 
                     end developer makes all of that accessible and convenient for the 
                     site’s users. The front end developer skill set, in particular, 
                     focuses on the user environment and experience.
